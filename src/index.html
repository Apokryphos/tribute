        <p>
          After graduating from the California College of the Arts in 1982, Mike
          Mignola moved to New York City and started work at Marvel Comics as an
          inker. He would later do work for DC Comics and Topps Comics before
          moving to Dark Horse Comics in 1993.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 1993, Mike Mignola created the character Hellboy: A tough as nails
          working stiff adopted demon with a stone right arm who investigates
          supernatural events for the Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense.
          Mignola writes the series himself, combining pulp fiction, horror, and
          folklore. Hellboy has continued to appear in comics for over twenty
          years, has spawned numerous spin-offs and adaptations, and has
          garnered many awards.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mike Mignola has done concept art for several films and productions.
          He designed the appearance of super-villain Mr. Freeze for
          <em>Batman: The Animated Series</em>. The first appearance of the
          character in the animated series was in the 1992 episode <em>Heart of Ice</em>.
          Mignola was a visual consultant on <em>Blade II</em> and the Hellboy movies.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some of Mike Mignola's comic creations have been made into films.
          Sci-Fi Channel released a pilot episode for an animated <em>The Amazing
          Screw-On Head</em> series in 2006. <em>Hellboy: Sword of Storms</em>,
          a direct-to-video animated film, was released in 2006. A second animated
          film, <em>Hellboy: Blood and Iron</em> was released in 2007. The visual
          style of the animated films was based on artist
          <a href="http://cheeks-74.tumblr.com/">Sean Galloway</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2016, Mike Mignola received the Grand Master Award at Spectrum 23.

          <h2>Hellboy</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>Hellboy</strong>: the world's greatest paranormal
            investigator. He was summoned by Grigori Rasputin and Nazi occultists
            in a 1944 ritual but Allied forces intervened. His
            adoption by Professor Bruttenholm lead to the creation of the
            <strong>
            <span title="Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense">
              B.P.R.D.
              </span>
            </strong> He's foiled frog monsters, mechanical apes,
            a flying head in a jar, and plenty of creatures from myth and
            folklore.
          </p>
          <p>
            The character first appeared in a 1993 convention sketch. The first
            comic series, <em>Hellboy: Seed of Destruction</em>, was published
            in 1994.

            occult threats from Nazi Germany.

          <h2>Lobster Johnson</h2>
          <p>First appearing in Hellboy: Box Full of Evil,
            <strong>The Lobster</strong> was
            a New York City vigilante operating during the Thirties. The
            Lobster battled Nazis, gangsters, and other villains, often in
            violent fashion, and was known for leaving his trademark lobster
            claw symbol burned into their foreheads.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the Hellboy universe, a fictional version of the character
            appeared in pulp stories, comics, and movies. The real Lobster
            perished while trying to prevent a Nazi rocket launch, but his
            ghost has appeared and aided Hellboy and other B.P.R.D members on
            several occasions.
          </p>
          <p>
            After appearances in the Hellboy and B.P.R.D. comic series,
            the <em>Lobster Johnson</em> series was published starting
            with <em>The Iron Prometheus</em>. The series was written by
            Mignola and John Arcudi with art by several artists.
